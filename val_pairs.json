Instructorships in abnormal psychology must be created in every medical\nschool; institutes for psychotherapy should soon follow. But in all this, there is nowhere\nto appear any artificial antithesis between mind and body, any more than between organic and\nfunctional diseases; we have discussed all that with full detail. Only the physician who has\na thorough psychological preparation can fulfill the manifold demands which modern life must\nraise; he alone is prepared to coöperate with the other factors of the community in the development\nof a sound and healthful nation, to work towards the hygiene of the nervous system and of the\nmental life; and to correct the injuries which the perversities of our civilization inflict.\n\nIn all that he will not avoid the comradeship of the clergyman. He will, of course, not forget\nthe fundamental difference of attitude between them, he will not forget that the minister seeks\nfor the meaning and values of inner life while he, the physician, has to consider that same\ninner life from a causal point of view and thus has to work with it as with natural material\nfor the normal functioning of the organism. But the interrelation between them can be intimate\nin spite of the difference of their standpoints. The minister, to be sure, ought not to consider\nhealth as such as the greatest good, but he will not forget that a wholesome devotion to ideals\ncannot be carried through when the attention is absorbed by the sufferings of the body and\nthe mental powers are debilitated. Only in a sound mind the full ideal meanings of life can\nbe realized. The minister must therefore seek the health of his congregation not because health\nis the ideal of life but because the true ideals cannot be appreciated by the mental cripple.\nOn the other hand, the physician from his standpoint should in no way feel it his duty to play\nthe amateur minister and to put emphasis on the spiritual uplifting of his patients. But he\nknows well that not a few of the suggestive influences which are needed for the relief from\ndisease are most effective when an emotional emphasis can be given to the suggestions and that\nthis emphasis is for large numbers most powerfully supplied by the religious emotion",

Then saith he to his servants, The wedding is ready, but they which were bidden were\nnot worthy. Go ye therefore into the highways, and as many as ye shall find, bid to the marriage.\nThe marriage feast was no surprize event, for the selected guests had been bidden long aforetime;\nand, in accordance with oriental custom were notified again on the opening day of the festivities,[1100]\nwhich, according to Hebrew customs, would be understood as extending over a period of seven\nor fourteen days; in this case of a marriage in the royal family the greater duration would\nbe assumed. Many of the bidden guests refused to come when formally summoned; and of the tolerant\nking's later and more pressing message they made light and went their ways, while the most\nwicked turned upon the servants who brought the royal summons, mistreated them cruelly, and\nsome of them they killed. It is plainly evident that the refusal to attend the king's feast\nwas a deliberate rebellion against the royal authority and a personal indignity against both\nthe reigning sovereign and his son. It was as much a duty as an honor for loyal subjects to\nattend the marriage festival of the prince, whom we cannot err in regarding as the lawful heir\nto the throne, and therefore the one who might some day reign over them. The turning away by\none man to his farm and by another to his merchandize is in part an evidence of their engrossment\nin material pursuits to the utter disregard of their sovereign's will; but it signifies further\nan effort to deaden their troubled consciences by some absorbing occupation; and possibly also\na premeditated demonstration of the fact that they placed their personal affairs above the\ncall of their king.

Analogous effects are produced\nwhen sound passes through a mixed medium, whether it consists of two different mediums or of\none medium where portions of it have different densities. As sound moves with different velocities\nthrough media of different densities, the wave which produces the sound will be partly reflected\nin passing from one medium to the other, and the direction of the transmitted wave changed;\nand hence in passing through such media different portions of the wave will reach the ear at\ndifferent times, and thus destroy the sharpness and distinctness of the sound.

Whence it follows, the more virtuous a Hero is, the better; since he more effectually\nanswers the true end of Epics. After all, Rapin says, the chief Excellency of an Heroic Poem\nconsists in the just proportion of the Parts; that perfect Union, just Agreement, and admirable\nRelation, which the Parts of this great Work bear one towards another; and blames Tasso for\nmingling all the Sweetness and Delicacy of Eclogues and Lyricks, with the Force of an Heroic\nPoem. But I should think him mistaken here, and that this is not the meaning of Aristotles\n[Greek: analogon]. For if we allow not such a pleasing Variety, how shall we excuse even Virgil\nhimself, who has his Dido, as well a Tasso his Armida and Erminia? nay, how shall we manage\nLove? which is usually one great Episode of Heroic, if not with something of Delicacy. I grant\nLove ought to have a different Air in different sorts of Poems; but still if it be natural\nit must have something of Softness; and for his Enchanted Forrest, which this severe Critic\nalso blames, I believe there's few who read that part of his Work, who would willingly have\nit omitted, for the sake of a fancied Regularity, any more than they would part with Mr. Dryden's\nImprovement on't in his King Arthur.

LTD.\n\nDRYDEN HOUSE, GERRARD STREET, W. 1908\n\nAll rights reserved\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe story of Love, that simple theme with variations ad libitum, ad infinitum, is never old,\nnever stale, never out-of-date.  And as we sometimes seek rest from the brilliant audacities\nand complex passions of Wagner or Tschaikowsky in the tender simplicity of some ancient English\nair, so we occasionally turn with relief from the wit and insight and subtlety of our modern\nnovelists to the old uncomplicated tales of faerie or romance, and find them after all more\nmoving, more tender, even more real, than all the laboured realism of these photographic days.\nAnd here before us is of all pretty love-stories perhaps the prettiest.  Idyllic as Daphnis\nand Chloe, romantic as Romeo and Juliet, tender as Undine, remote as Cupid and Psyche, yet\nwith perpetual touches of actual life, and words that raise pictures; and lightened all through\nwith a dainty playfulness, as if Ariel himself had hovered near all the time of its writing,\nand Puck now and again shot a whisper of suggestion.\n\nYet it is only of late years that the charm of this story has been truly appreciated.  Composed\nprobably in Northern France, about the close of the twelfth century,--the time of our own Angevin\nkings and the most brilliant period of Old-French literature,--it has survived only in a single\nmanuscript of later date, where it is found hidden among a number of tales in verse less pleasing\nin subject and far less delightful in form.  There it had lain unknown till discovered by M.\nde Sainte-Palaye, and printed by him in modernised French in 1752, one hundred and fifty years\nago.  There is no space here to follow its fortunes since.  Even after this revival it was\nnot till more than one hundred years later that it began to attain to any wide recognition",

Tired,\nhe rested in as comfortable a corner as he could on his way. Hungry, he determined to taste\nthe pasty he was carrying. Inserting his thumb into the pie, he found nothing but parchment\ndeeds. One of these he pulled out and pocketed, as likely to be valuable.

The offices in the Rue Quincampoix, a street then inhabited by bankers,\nstock-brokers, and exchange agents, were besieged all day long with crowds of eager competitors\nfor shares.  The street was choked with fine equipages, until it was found absolutely necessary\nto close it against all horses and carriages.  All the rank and fashion of Paris flung itself\ninto this game of speculation.  Every one has heard the story of the hunchback who made a little\nfortune by the letting of his hump as a desk on which impatient speculators might scribble\ntheir applications for shares.  A French novelist, M. Paul Feval, has made good use of {185}\nthis story, and London still remembers to what a brilliant dramatic account it was turned by\nMr. Fechter.  Law was the most powerful and the most courted man of his day.  In his youth\nhe had been a gallant and a free liver, a man of dress and fashion and intrigue, who delighted\nin scandalous entanglements with women.  The fashion and beauty of Paris was for the hour at\nhis feet.  Think of a brilliant gallant who could make one rich in a moment!  The mother of\nthe Regent described in a coarse and pungent sentence the sort of homage which Parisian ladies\nwould have been willing to pay to Law if he had so desired.  St. Simon, the mere littérateur\nand diplomatist, kept his head almost alone, and was not to be dazzled.  Since the fable of\nMidas, he said, he had not heard of any one having the power to turn all he touched into gold,\nand he did not believe that virtue was given to M. Law.  There is no doubt that Law was a man\nof great ability as a financier, and that his scheme in the beginning had promise in it.  It\nwas, as Burke has said of the scheme and its author, the public enthusiasm, and not Law himself,\nwhich chose to build on the base of his scheme a structure which it could not bear.  It does\nnot seem by any means certain that a project quite as wild might not be launched in London\nor Paris at the present day, and find almost as great a temporary success, and blaze, like\nLaw's, the comet of a season.

For (he says) the knowledge attainable\nby us of the laws of the universe is at best fragmentary, and incapable of reduction to a real\nunity. An objective synthesis, the dream of Descartes and the best thinkers of old, is impossible.\nThe laws of the real world are too numerous, and the manner of their working into one another\ntoo intricate, to be, as a general rule, correctly traced and represented by our reason. The\nonly connecting principle in our knowledge is its relation to our wants, and it is upon that\nwe must found our systematization. The answer to this is, first, that there is no necessity\nfor an universal synthesis; and secondly, that the same arguments may be used against the possibility\nof a complete subjective, as of a complete objective systematization. A subjective synthesis\nmust consist in the arrangement and co-ordination of all useful knowledge, on the basis of\nits relation to human wants and interests. But those wants and interests are, like the laws\nof the universe, extremely multifarious, and the order of preference among them in all their\ndifferent gradations (for it varies according to the degree of each) cannot be cast into precise\ngeneral propositions.

As early as 1803 Ritter had attempted\nto make such a secondary battery. In 1843 Grove also attempted it. But it was not until 1859,\nwhen Gaston Planche produced his invention, that anything like a reasonably satisfactory storage\nbattery was made. Planche discovered that sheets of lead immersed in dilute sulphuric acid\nwere very satisfactory for the production of polarization effects. He constructed a battery\nof sheets of lead immersed in sulphuric acid, and, after charging these for several hours from\nthe cells of an ordinary Bunsen battery, was able to get currents of great strength and considerable\nduration. This battery, however, from its construction of lead, was necessarily heavy and cumbersome.\nFaure improved it somewhat by coating the lead plates with red-lead, thus increasing the capacity\nof the cell. Faure's invention gave a fresh impetus to inventors, and shortly after the market\nwas filled with storage batteries of various kinds, most of them modifications of Planche's\nor Faure's. The ardor of enthusiastic inventors soon flagged, however, for all these storage\nbatteries proved of little practical account in the end, as compared with other known methods\nof generating power.\n\nThree methods of generating electricity are in general use: static or frictional electricity\nis generated by \"plate\" or \"static\" machines; galvanic, generated by batteries based on Volta's\ndiscovery; and induced, or faradic, generated either by chemical or mechanical action. There\nis still another kind, thermo-electricity, that may be generated in a most simple manner. In\n1821 Seebecle, of Berlin, discovered that when a circuit was formed of two wires of different\nmetals, if there be a difference in temperature at the juncture of these two metals an electrical\ncurrent will be established.

Study of the second and more complete specimen reveals that Hesperoherpeton is\nunlike the known Embolomeri in many important features. The limbs and braincase are more primitive\nthan those so far described in any amphibian. The vertebrae are comparable to those of Ichthyostegalia\n(Jarvik, 1952), as well as to those of Embolomeri. The forelimb is transitional between the\npectoral fin of Rhipidistia and the limb of early Amphibia. The pattern of the bones of the\nforelimb closely resembles, but is simpler than, that of the hypothetical transitional type\nsuggested by Eaton (1951). The foot seemingly had only four short digits. The hind limb is\nnot known.\n\nThe new skeleton of Hesperoherpeton lies in an oblong block of limy shale measuring approximately\n100 × 60 mm. After preparation of the entire lower surface, the exposed bones and matrix were\nembedded in Bioplastic, in a layer thin enough for visibility but giving firm support. Then\nthe specimen was inverted and the matrix removed from the opposite side; this has not been\ncovered with Bioplastic. The bones lie in great disorder, except that some parts of the roof\nof the skull are associated, and the middle section of the vertebral column is approximately\nin place. The bones of the left forelimb are close together but not in a natural position.\nThe tail, pelvis, hind limbs and right forelimb are missing. Nearly all the bones present are\nbroken, distorted by crushing, incomplete and scattered out of place, probably by the action\nof currents. The complete skeleton, in life, probably measured between 150 and 200 mm. in length.\n\nThe specimen was studied at the Museum of Natural History, University of Kansas, with the help\nof a grant from the National Science Foundation, number NSF-G8624.

And as we sometimes seek rest from the brilliant audacities\nand complex passions of Wagner or Tschaikowsky in the tender simplicity of some ancient English\nair, so we occasionally turn with relief from the wit and insight and subtlety of our modern\nnovelists to the old uncomplicated tales of faerie or romance, and find them after all more\nmoving, more tender, even more real, than all the laboured realism of these photographic days.\nAnd here before us is of all pretty love-stories perhaps the prettiest.  Idyllic as Daphnis\nand Chloe, romantic as Romeo and Juliet, tender as Undine, remote as Cupid and Psyche, yet\nwith perpetual touches of actual life, and words that raise pictures; and lightened all through\nwith a dainty playfulness, as if Ariel himself had hovered near all the time of its writing,\nand Puck now and again shot a whisper of suggestion.\n\nYet it is only of late years that the charm of this story has been truly appreciated.  Composed\nprobably in Northern France, about the close of the twelfth century,--the time of our own Angevin\nkings and the most brilliant period of Old-French literature,--it has survived only in a single\nmanuscript of later date, where it is found hidden among a number of tales in verse less pleasing\nin subject and far less delightful in form.

He has never adopted the studied reticence\nof Kitchener nor yet the chill aloofness of certain of his colleagues. War correspondents are\nnot anathema to him; neither does he shudder at the sight of the reporter's pencil. Yet, somehow,\nfew anecdotes cluster round his name.\n\nPerhaps that is because his modesty is not a pose, although it has become almost a tradition.\nIt is simply a natural trait in a modest and rather retiring disposition. French simply will\nnot be talked about--and there is an end of the matter.\n\nIf one were asked to describe the man, one might best answer that he is the Englishman to the\nnth. degree. It is usual to find that the man of extraordinary merit is in some degree a contrast\nwith and a criticism of the mere average mortal of his set. The dour urbanity of Kitchener,\nfor instance, is Oriental rather than English, and contrasts strangely with the choleric tradition\nof the army officer. So the infinite alertness and constant good humour of Roberts has a quality\nof Latin esprit very foreign to the English temperament. But there are no such peculiarities\nabout French. He is the very essence of healthy normality.\n\nYet, although of Celtic descent, he is essentially English. He has not hacked his way to fame\nin the manner of the Scot, nor has he leapt upon her pedestal with the boisterous humour of\nthe Irishman. He has got there in the dogged but sporting English way, taking Fortune's gifts\nwhen they came, but never pushing or scrambling for them when they were out of reach.\n\nOne catches the spirit of the man in the schoolboy. When he first went to school at Harrow,\nthe boys, knowing that sisters had been responsible for his education, were prepared to take\nit out of him. But as French was ready to fight at the slightest provocation, and equally ready\nto swear eternal friendship when the fight was done, he quickly won his way through respect\nto popularity.\n\n[Page Heading: AN ADMIRER OF NAPOLEON]\n\nDespite this quality, the steadfast object of his admiration has been one of the most abnormal\nand theatrical figures in history--Napoleon",

The abnormal tactual\n     sensation forced on consciousness the idea of the cutting of the\n     wrist. The necessary counter action would be to force to\n     consciousness the idea of the uninjured wrist and the corresponding\n     reactions. As the wrist can be easily made accessible to sight and\n     as I anticipated that the visual sensations would be more forceful\n     than the tactual ones, I told him to look straight at his own\n     wrists for ten minutes three times a day after waking, after\n     luncheon, and before going to bed. He had to hold his two forearms\n     close in front of his eyes and stare at them, giving his full\n     attention to the visual impression of the smooth, uninjured skin of\n     the wrist. If during this process, the tactual counter-sensations\n     were vivid, he had to go on with the staring at both arms, both\n     held near together until the perception had crowded out the rival\n     touch sensation. When this performance had been carried out six\n     times, he did not notice the coming up of the tactual sensation\n     with vividness any longer. From the third day it had disappeared\n     entirely. I told him to go on with the process still every morning\n     for some weeks. The physician himself considered the cure as\n     complete.\n\nOur first case dealt with hypnosis, our second case removed the intruding idea by a perception\nin a waking state. To point at once to the variety of methods which we sketched, we may turn\nagain to a case of emotionless idea removed by the method of switching off and side-tracking\nthe originating and physiological \"complex.\"\n\n     The patient is a school-teacher in the Middle West, a nervous,\n     thin-looking woman of about twenty-five.

She never had any intimate acquaintance with any man,\n     she was never engaged, she hated bitterly every thought of\n     immorality, she knows and has assured herself by much reading that\n     it is entirely impossible that she might get a child without sexual\n     contact.

Some of his most capable colleagues had\nbroken away from him, and he probably began to feel that the reformers all over the country\nexpected more of him than he saw his way to accomplish.  In 1834 he asked to be relieved from\nthe duties of his office, and the King consented, probably with greater good-will than he had\nfelt in acceding to some of Lord Grey's previous requests, and accordingly Lord Grey ceased\nto be Prime Minister.  With his resignation of office Lord Grey passes out of this history\nand takes an abiding place in the Parliamentary history of his country.  He can hardly be called\na great statesman, for he had been mainly instrumental in bringing to success and putting into\nlegislative form the ideas of greater men, but his must be regarded as a distinguished and\nnoble figure among England's Parliamentary leaders.  He was especially suited for the work\nwhich it was his proud fortune to accomplish at the zenith of his power, for no one could be\nbetter fitted than he for the task of discountenancing the wild alarms which were felt by so\nmany belonging to what were called the privileged classes at the thought of any measures of\nreform which might disturb the existing order of things, and lead to red ruin and the breaking-up\nof laws.

But the interrelation between them can be intimate\nin spite of the difference of their standpoints. The minister, to be sure, ought not to consider\nhealth as such as the greatest good, but he will not forget that a wholesome devotion to ideals\ncannot be carried through when the attention is absorbed by the sufferings of the body and\nthe mental powers are debilitated. Only in a sound mind the full ideal meanings of life can\nbe realized. The minister must therefore seek the health of his congregation not because health\nis the ideal of life but because the true ideals cannot be appreciated by the mental cripple.\nOn the other hand, the physician from his standpoint should in no way feel it his duty to play\nthe amateur minister and to put emphasis on the spiritual uplifting of his patients. But he\nknows well that not a few of the suggestive influences which are needed for the relief from\ndisease are most effective when an emotional emphasis can be given to the suggestions and that\nthis emphasis is for large numbers most powerfully supplied by the religious emotion",

The bit was cut out without the slightest noise, and\nthen, when the door was opened, was placed, just inside, upon the floor. The man then with\nperfectly noiseless step entered the room, knelt again,--just where poor Lizzie had knelt as\nshe said her prayers,--so that he might the more easily raise the iron box without a struggle,\nand left the room with it in his arms without disturbing the lovely sleeper. He then descended\nthe stairs, passed into the coffee-room at the bottom of them, and handed the box through an\nopen window to a man who was crouching on the outside in the dark.

The statement made by Alexander and Kreidl\nto the effect that the dancer is almost full grown by the thirty-first day of life is false.\nAt that age they may be sexually mature, but usually they are far from full grown.\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nBEHAVIOR: DANCE MOVEMENTS\n\nThe peculiarities of behavior of the dancing mouse are responsible alike for the widespread\ninterest which it has aroused, and for its name. In a little book on fancy varieties of mice,\nin which there is much valuable information concerning the care of the animals, one who styles\nhimself \"An old fancier\" writes thus of the behavior of the dancer: \"I believe most people\nhave an idea that the waltzing is a stately dance executed on the hind feet; this is not so.\nThe performer simply goes round and round on all fours, as fast as possible, the head pointing\ninwards. The giddy whirl, after continuing for about a dozen turns, is then reversed in direction,\nand each performance usually occupies from one to two minutes. Whether it is voluntary or not,\nis difficult to determine, but I am inclined to think the mouse can refrain if it wishes to\ndo so, because I never see them drop any food they may be eating, and begin to waltz in the\nmidst of their meal. The dance, if such it can be called, generally seizes the mouse when it\nfirst emerges from its darkened sleeping place, and this would lead one to suppose that the\nlight conveys an impression of shock to the brain, through the eyes, which disturbs the diseased\ncenters and starts the giddy gyrations. The mice can walk or run in a fairly straight line\nwhen they wish to do so.\" Some of the old fancier's statements are true, others are mere guesses.\nThose who have studied the mice carefully will doubtless agree that he has not adequately described\nthe various forms of behavior of which they are capable. I have quoted his description as an\nillustration of the weakness which is characteristic of most popular accounts of animal behavior.\nIt proves that it is not sufficient to watch and then describe. The fact is that he who adequately\ndescribes the behavior of any animal watches again and again under natural and experimental\nconditions, and by prolonged and patient observation makes himself so familiar with his subject\nthat it comes to possess an individuality as distinctive as that of his human companions",

Rashi wished to put an end to these debates and introduce some unity into\nrabbinical tradition, and generally his purpose in refraining from a quotation of his predecessors\nwas exactly to avoid an opening into the field of controversy.  Finally, their commentaries,\nit seems, were not comprehensive; they bore upon only one or several treatises; whereas Rashi's\nbore on all or nearly all the treatises of the Gemara.[95]  With Rashi execution rose to the\nheight of his conception.\n\nRashi availed himself so little of the work of his masters that he began by establishing a\ncorrect text of the Talmud and subjecting it to a severe revision.  The mistakes of his predecessors\noftenest arose from the faultiness of the texts, marred by ignorant copyists or presumptuous\nreaders.  What is more, the use to which the Talmud was put in the academies and the discussions\nto which it gave rise, far from sheltering it from alterations made by way of correction, modified\nit in every conceivable fashion, according to the views of the chiefs of the schools.  Like\nevery book in circulation, the Talmud was exposed to the worst changes, and this all the more\nreadily, because at that time no one had a notion of what we call respect for the text, for\nthe idea of the author.  As rigidly as the text of the Bible was maintained intact in the very\nminutest details, so lax was the treatment of the Talmud, which was at the mercy of individual\nwhim.
